## RULES AND HOW TO PLAY CONNECT FOUR:
The Connect 4 Board Game Rules are easy to understand. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.
The game is over either when you or your friend reaches four in a row, or when all forty two slots are filled, ending in a stalemate. If you and your friend decide to play again, the loser typically goes first.
